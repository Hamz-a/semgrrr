  message: >-

    Laravel disallows mass-assignments by default. Developers can use the $fillable property to explicitly allow certain fields to be mass-assigned. In contrast, the $guarded property can be used to explicitly disallow certain fields to be mass-assigned. However, by setting the value of the $guarded property to an empty array, the default protection mechanism provided by Laravel to thwart mass-assignment vulnerabilities is entirely disabled.
